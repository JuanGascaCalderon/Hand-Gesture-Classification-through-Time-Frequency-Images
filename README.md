# Hand-Gesture-Classification-through-Time-Frequency-Images
Classification of hand grip postures using surface EMG signals from amputee patients. Features are extracted using time-frequency analysis (STFT), and a CNN-based model is applied. The method achieves up to 91.13% accuracy in individual classifications and 87.97% in K-fold cross-validation.
